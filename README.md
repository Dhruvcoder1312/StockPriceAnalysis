# Stock Price Analysis using Linear Regression Model

Overview:

This project focuses on predicting stock prices using a linear regression model. Stock price prediction is a significant challenge in finance, and accurate predictions can provide valuable insights for investors and financial analysts. By analyzing historical stock data and leveraging machine learning techniques, this project aims to build a model that can forecast future stock prices with reasonable accuracy.

Project Objectives:

->Analyze historical stock data to identify trends and patterns.
->Develop a linear regression model to predict future stock prices.
->Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
->Visualize the actual vs. predicted stock prices to understand the model's accuracy.

Dataset:

The dataset used in this project consists of historical stock prices, including attributes such as open, high, low, close prices, and trading volume.
The data spans from January 2024 to December 2024.

Source: The dataset is generated for demonstration purposes and includes synthetic stock price data.

Data Preparation
Dataset Description
The dataset includes the following columns:

1.date: The trading date.
2.open: Opening price of the stock.
3.high: Highest price of the stock during the trading day.
4.low: Lowest price of the stock during the trading day.
5.close: Closing price of the stock.
6.volume: Number of shares traded.

Preprocessing Steps:
Scaling: The stock prices and trading volume are scaled using StandardScaler to normalize the data.
Feature Engineering:
Simple Moving Average (SMA_20): Calculated as the mean closing price over the last 20 days.
Volatility: Calculated as the standard deviation of the closing prices over the last 20 days.
Model Building
Linear Regression Model
Initialization: The linear regression model is initialized and trained using the training dataset.
Features: The model uses features like scaled opening, high, low, closing prices, volume, SMA_20, and volatility.
Training: The model is trained on 80% of the dataset, and the remaining 20% is used for testing.
Evaluation
Performance Metrics
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Used to evaluate the accuracy of the model by measuring the average magnitude of errors in the predictions.

Results:
The results of the model evaluation include:

->MAE Value: Indicates the average error in the predicted stock prices.
->Visualization: A plot showing the actual vs. predicted stock prices, helping to visually assess the model's performance.

Conclusion:
The project demonstrates the application of linear regression in predicting stock prices. While the model provides a reasonable estimate, stock prices are influenced by numerous factors, and more sophisticated models might be required for higher accuracy.

Future Work:
Include more features: Incorporate additional features such as technical indicators and sentiment analysis.
Advanced Models: Explore advanced machine learning models like LSTM, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting.
Real-world Data: Use real historical stock data for more practical insights.
